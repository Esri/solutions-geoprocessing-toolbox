## Patrol Data Capture
This toolbox contains the model for processing GPS data into ArcGIS to create patrol tracks on a map. Most GPS navigation devices allow you to export a .gpx file that can be used in ArcGIS. 

These tools help you:
• Importing the .gpx data 
• Removing spikes (removing errors, for example, points the GPS created when connection to satellite was temporarily lost). Also known as de-spiking the data 
• Making sure each track is distinguished from other tracks (has not merged into a previous or subsequent track) 
• Creating the track lines in a layer by appending them to the layer 
• Rejoining tracks
