## Maritime Decision Aid Tools

Tools included in this toolbox help analysts understand threats against operations in the maritime domain. Some of these geoprocessing tools help analysts understand the capabilities of submarines, such as where submarines can physically operate and areas where they have an advantage (such as in canyons). Other tools are more general in nature and can be used for understanding where a vessel can travel in an amount of time, as well as how far a vessel can see based off of height of the viewer.

* Farthest On Circle
* Find Submarine Canyons
* Sub Depth Restriction Analysis
* Sub Specifications Tool
* Visibility Range at Sea

## Military Aspects Of Terrain Tools

Contains tools used in the Military Aspects Of Terrain (MAoT) template. They are tools for doing terrain analysis as part of the Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield process.
These tools are part of the Military Aspects of Terrain template: http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e3efcbb9fb9f442caeb9968bdf9b8f37

## Path Slope Tools

Path Slope Tools is a terrain analysis toolset to determine slope changes along linear features (paths). For example finding percent slope along roadways or degree slope along trails.These can then be used to determine vehicle crossing limits or areas dangerous to hikers.

* Path Slope
* Path Slope By Custom Table
* Path Slope By Reclass Values
