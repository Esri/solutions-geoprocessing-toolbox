Multidimension Supplemental Tools
Version: 1.2

This version requires ArcGIS 10.1 Service Pack 1. However, ArcGIS 10.2 is preferred.
The Multidimensional Zonal Statistics tools require the Spatial Analyst Extension.

tools to the toolbox:

1.  Get Variable Statistics
2.  Get Variable Statistics Over Dimension
3.  Multidimensional Zonal Statistics
4.  Multidimensional Zonal Statistics as Table

Version 1.2 provides bug fixes, layer support, and performance improvements for the
zonal tools.
