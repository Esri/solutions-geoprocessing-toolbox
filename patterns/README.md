## Incident Analysis Tools

These tools help you discover spatial patterns and trends in significant activity in your area of interest.
These tools are part of the Incident Analysis Template: http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=fd6e2c3272c14826b9781e93580dacfe

* Cluster Analysis
* Count Incidents By LOC
* Find Percent Change
* Hot Spots By Area
* Incident Density
* Incident Hot Spots
* Incident Table To Point

## Landsat Tools
These tools help to pre-process Landsat 5 and 7 data to prepare it for Change Detection. The toolbox includes:

* DN to Reflectance
* Landsat 7 Gap Filler
* LTK Cloud Detector
* ACCA Cloud Detector 

The toolset is based upon the ArcGISScriptTools by Jerrod Lessel: https://github.com/jerrod-lessel/ArcgisScriptTools

## Change Detection Tools

These tools help you to identify change in your image. There are a number of tools within the toolbox:

* Cloud Mask model
* Dark Object Subtraction model
* Pseudo Invariant Factor model
* Iteratively Re-weighted MAD script 

The IR-MAD script is based on the below references:
