## Adjust Sample Data Dates Tools

This toolbox contains a tool to adjust the date fields of the sample data included with the Inciedent Analysis toolbox.
These tools are a part of the Incident Analysis Template: http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=384d223647b24bcf9d2c6fd44f90d17f

* Change Sample Data Dates to Recent Dates

## Build Elevation Mosaic Tools

This toolbox contains tools that take raster or LIDAR data and create surface or terrain mosaics.

* Build Elevation Mosaics
* Create Derived Elevation Mosaic
* Create Source Elevation Mosaics
* Create Source LAS Ground Elevation Mosaics
* Create Source LAS Surface Elevation Mosaics

## Geonames Tools

Tools for building geonames locator.

* Create Geonames Gazetter Locator
* Load Geonames File

## Imagery Basemap Tools

Tools to assist in building an imagery basemap from standard defense raster formats.

* Add CIB Rasters to Mosaic Dataset
* Calculate Raster Visibility
* Create CIB Mosaic Dataset

## Network Data Preparation Tools

These tools are used to prepare road data for use in a road network dataset.

* Add Orientation Angle To Lines
* Add Travel Time To Roads
* Feature Class to Feature Class (System Tool)
* Split Lines At Intersections

## Patrol Data Capture Tools

Includes tools to import data that has been gathered on or after a patrol. This includes GPS data, saved in .gpx files, and Patrol Report data, saved in .xml files (as saved by an Infopath form)
These tools are a part of the Patrol Data Capture template: http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6238c4cdb3ca4a7ea54287241f53349f

* Append Tracks to DB
* Despike GPS Log
* Distinguish Tracks
* GPX to Layer
* Import Patrol Rpt
* Make Track Lines
* Recalculate Delta Times
* Rejoin Track Parts
* Remove Duplicate GPS Data

## Import and Conversion Tools (formerly Position Analysis Tools)

Tools for converting tabular information to different geometries, and generating coordinate location datasets.

* Convert Coordinates
* Locate Event
* Table To 2-Point Line
* Table To Ellipse
* Table To Line Of Bearing
* Table To Point
* Table To Polygon
* Table To Polyline

** - Range Rings has been removed from Import and conversion as it is a duplication of the same tool in Visibility and Range Tools.

## Publishable Task Tools

Publishable Tasks are a series of models that should be published as geoprocessing services for:

* Fast Visibility: visibility tools optimized to be run as geoprocessing services
  * Fast Visibility By Circle
  * Fast Visibility By Distance
  * Fast Visibility By Line
  * Fast Visibility By Parameters

* Road Network: tools for routing and drive time
  * Drive Time
  * Point-to-Point Route

## Scanned Map Basemap Tools

Tools for building a basemap from CADRG/ECRG scanned imagery.
These tools are part of the Scanned Maps Template: http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=7837d4e358c644a98cf47f395e61d84d

* Add Miscellaneous CADRG/ECRG Rasters To Mosaic Dataset
* Add Standard CADRG/ECRG Rasters To Mosaic Dataset
* Calculate Raster Visibility
* Create CADRG/ECRG Mosaic Dataset

## Topographic Basemap Tools

Tools to assist in building a topographic basemap from feature data in the Urban Topographic Data Store (NGA's TFDM) geodatabase schema.
These tools are part of the Topographic Basemap Map Template: http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a2368ba5e3ac4459851a1ac3b5891c08

* Add DTED 1,2 to Elevation Mosaic Dataset
* Create Elevation Mosaic Dataset
