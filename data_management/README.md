## Relationship to mdcs-py
Mosaic Dataset Configuration Scripts (MDCS) is a set of tools used to create and manage mosaic datasets in ArcGIS. A few of the Data Management toolboxes in this repository require the MDCS tools to run:

* CADRG ECRG Tools.pyt
* CIB Tools.pyt
* Elevation Tool.pyt

MDCS is maintained as a separate repository from Solutions Geoprocessing Toolbox ([mdcs-py](https://github.com/Esri/mdcs-py)). But for convenience the mdcs-py repository has been copied to a subfolder named **mdcs**.

## Adjust Sample Data Dates Tools

This toolbox contains a tool to adjust the date fields of the sample data included with the Inciedent Analysis toolbox.

* Change Sample Data Dates to Recent Dates

These tools are a part of the [Incident Analysis Template](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=384d223647b24bcf9d2c6fd44f90d17f)

## CADRG ECRG Tools

This toolbox will help to automate the creation of CADRG/ECRG Mosaic Datasets. 

* CADRG/ECRG Mosaic Datasets

## CIB Tools

* Create CIB Mosaic

## Elevation Tools

* Create Derived Elevation Mosaic
* Create Source Elevation Mosaic

## Geonames Tools

Tools for building geonames locator.

* Create Geonames Gazetter Locator
* Load Geonames File

## Import and Conversion Tools (formerly Position Analysis Tools)

Tools for converting tabular information to different geometries, and generating coordinate location datasets.

* Convert Coordinates
* Locate Event
* Table To 2-Point Line
* Table To Ellipse
* Table To Line Of Bearing
* Table To Point
* Table To Polygon
* Table To Polyline

** - Range Rings has been removed from Import and Conversion as it is a duplication of the same tool in Visibility and Range Tools.

## LiDAR Elevation Tools

This toolbox contains tools that  create surface or terrain mosaics from LiDAR data.

* Create Source LAS Ground Elevation Mosaic
* Create Source LAS Surface Elevation Mosaic

## Network Data Preparation Tools

These tools are used to prepare road data for use in a road network dataset.

* Add Orientation Angle To Lines
* Add Travel Time To Roads
* Feature Class to Feature Class (System Tool)
* Split Lines At Intersections

## Patrol Data Capture Tools

Includes tools to import data that has been gathered on or after a patrol. This includes GPS data, saved in .gpx files, and Patrol Report data, saved in .xml files (as saved by an Infopath form)
These tools are a part of the Patrol Data Capture template: http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6238c4cdb3ca4a7ea54287241f53349f

* Append Tracks to DB
* Despike GPS Log
* Distinguish Tracks
* GPX to Layer
* Import Patrol Rpt
* Make Track Lines
* Recalculate Delta Times
* Rejoin Track Parts
* Remove Duplicate GPS Data

## Publishable Task Tools

Publishable Tasks are a series of models that should be published as geoprocessing services for:

* Fast Visibility: visibility tools optimized to be run as geoprocessing services
  * Fast Visibility By Circle
  * Fast Visibility By Distance
  * Fast Visibility By Line
  * Fast Visibility By Parameters

* Road Network: tools for routing and drive time
  * Drive Time
  * Point-to-Point Route
