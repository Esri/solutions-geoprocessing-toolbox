## ERG Tools

Two tools that enable the implementation of the 2012 Emergency Response Guidebook, for when an emergency responder encounters a spill of a hazardous substance. By entering either the name of the hazardous substance, or a Placard ID, along with a number of other parameters that define the size of the spill, the time of day and the wind direction, the areas of Initial Isolation and Protective Action can be calculated and displayed.
